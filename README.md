# WebScrapping project 

## Description

This project gathers data from both single and multiple pages. The repository encompasses all the code and queries that I have developed and uploaded. Within this repository, you'll find projects focused on web scraping for both single and multiple pages. Jupyter Notebook was employed for extracting data from websites. The raw data retrieval utilized Requests and Beautiful Soup libraries, and Pandas was employed to store the data in a .csv format. This .csv format can be leveraged in Tableau for data visualization, or alternatively, SQL queries can be executed to derive additional insights and address specific problem statements. Furthermore, insights can be obtained using the Python programming language too.

## Features

-For Single Page Webscrapping, I have used data which was in Table format on website.                                

-For Multiple Pages, I have used Non- Structed data from website.


## Getting Started

Instially there must be a website whose data is free avaiable over Internet.

## Installation

There must be three libraries need to install on your system. They are Requests, BeatifulSoup and Pandas. Below are cmd to install them.

pip install requests  

pip install beautifulsoup4  

pip install pandas


## Dependencies

This above projects are dependent on Requests, BeatifulSoup and Pandas libraries. 

## Necessary details

I have mentioned both websites details which is Structured and Non-Structured data in my code.
